# kubem8 - Kubernetes Administration for Newbies 🛳️
*Your friendly kube-mate for managing pods, logs, scaling, and more — without the yak shaving*. ;)

These are simple Bash helpers for working with `kubectl` without needing to manually copy full pod names every time.

Each script has the option/flag definitions in the code themselves.

By using these tools, it is assumed that you are using Bash **and** have kubectl installed, with a cluster that is online.

---

## 🧰 Features
🔍 Search pods and deployments by name substring.

🧾 View pod logs with klog, nicely colorized for JSON-formatted log lines (INFO/ERROR/TRACE), including multi-line stack traces.

📄 Describe pods and deployments with kdescribe, showing detailed info and rich metadata.

🗑️ Delete pods and deployments safely with kdel, including interactive selection and confirmation prompts.

🚀 Interactive prompt if multiple matches found, to pick the exact resource.

🧭 Optional `-n` / `--namespace` flag support for all commands; defaults to the default namespace if not specified.

➡️ Optional `-t` / `--type` flag support for all commands; defaults to "pod" if not specified.

🧼 Clean, readable output formatting with colors and aligned columns—no extra dependencies like jq required.

🚫 Does not require jq or any third-party tools (except kubectl).

## 📦 Installation
Copy both scripts to a directory in your `$PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/`):
```
sudo cp klog /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp kdescribe /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp kdel /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/klog /usr/local/bin/kdescribe /usr/local/bin/kdel
```

## 🛠️ Usage
```
klog pod-substring                 # searches in 'default' namespace
klog -n your-namespace pod-name    # searches in given namespace
###############
kdescribe pod-substring
kdescribe -n your-namespace pod-name
```
*If multiple matches are found, you’ll be prompted to choose.*

### Examples/Usage
```
ubuntu@host:~$ klog iam
Multiple matches found:
1) iama-pod-6fbd544566-h9bm9
2) iama-pod-6fbd544566-vf2kg
Select a pod number: 2
Showing logs for: iama-pod-6fbd544566-vf2kg

or...
```
# Describe deployment with 'web' in the name in namespace 'prod'
kdescribe -n prod web
# Delete pod with 'cache' in the name in namespace 'staging'
kdel -n staging cache
```
or...
```
kscale get system-web-ui -n dev
# => Deployment bigid-ui in namespace 'bigid' has 1 replicas configured.

kscale some-random-pod 2
# => Interactively matches and confirms scaling to 2
```

## Notes
- These scripts default to your current Kubernetes context and namespace and assume kubectl is installed, configured, and has access to your cluster
- Supports **partial substring** matches for pod names.
- You may hardcode a namespace by modifying the NAMESPACE_ARG variable inside the scripts.
- Works best with reasonably short and unique search strings to avoid large result sets.

## Future Plans 💡
- Package each script into one binary (i.e., kubem8) for easier application and deployment.
- Prettier output
- Potential rebuild with Python, to leverage and include jq for more efficient log parsing
